            Our idea came from the fact that there are some multiplayer games that can’t be played alone. So we want to choose a game that is currently requiring several players, and turn it into a single player game. This way, we can enjoy those games and not bother finding a friend to play with.(Which sometimes can be tricky or impossible)
            We chose a classic online game CatchMind(캐치마인드), and we’re willing to use Deep Learning technique so that it can be played solo. We shall call our version of the game “SketchMind”(스케치마인드).
            Our final outcome will be a SketchMind website where users can login and enjoy the game. It will consist of two main functions : “SketchMind game” and “Revenge of the AI”
            ‘SketchMind game’ is the function that users will be able to draw the free-hand sketch using their mice and pens on their device. When users finish the sketch and submit it, our pre-trained classifier comes into play. And it would tell the user back what the drawing was about.
            ‘Revenge of the AI’ is the function that users guess the label from the plausible drawing (it would generate a new drawing that it hasn’t seen as training data) that is generated by the model.
